Plot:
Intro:
The player just get to see the execution of our main character(MC) Either a flash or a bullet... Everything that seems convincigly deadly but it has to be deduced (not too explicit).
Then the main game will take place in our MC's brain.
As a criminal the man is willing to save his soul before God's sends him to hell. With all his might, he wants, at the very least, say sorry for the bad he has spread during his misearable lifetime.
The game is, therfore, a run of a millisecond... The last millisecond of his life.

Through multiple sounds and effects the player is being subtly shown that he is in a last breath's brain(he doesnt explicitly know it).
As he have, during his whole lifetime, escaped from what his conscience was telling him, the further the character goes the darker and harder levels get. In deed every level has to show, how the man has deliberately chosen the wrong path and hence, pushed his soul to the very bottom of his heart. 

Thus the levels are going downward(it has to be understood but levels with inversed physics or so are of course a good idea)
At the very end the man faces his soul, which he cannot defeat... and in the end our character will eventually die.

The moral message we are trying to send is, that, if you wait for your death to start becoming a good personn there is a massive chance that you'll not manage to do so. And if, during your life you've always chosen bad, you are not going to change at the last second...
