# Anima  
Project Group - Projet Transverse EFREI 2025  
By François-Xavier Sabatier, Benoit Tailhades, Raphaël Cayeux, Aymeric Danlos and Loïc Giannini  
 
## Concept  
“What if the last millisecond of your life was your only chance for redemption?”
Anima is a narrative-driven platformer set in the final moment of a man's life — a criminal seeking redemption just before his death. The player dives into the dying mind of this man, navigating a surreal and decaying landscape shaped by guilt, denial, and past sins.  

## Gameplay Summary  
The game begins with a brief and implicit execution scene — a gunshot, a flash...  
The player then enters the Main caracter’s mind, experiencing a fast-paced platformer reflecting his psychological descent that he has lived throuhought his all life.  
Each level goes deeper, becoming darker and more chaotic, showing how he ignored his conscience throughout his life.  
At the end, the player confronts the Main caracter’s soul — an unwinnable boss fight.  
The journey ends with the inevitable death, underlining the game’s core moral: "It is never too late to beg pardon until it is" .  

This game isn't just a platformer — it's a philosophical journey. The goal: show that waiting until your last breath to change your ways is often too late. We want players to feel the weight of choices, even in retrospect, and question the illusion of last-minute redemption.
